;
; This is the database initialization file.  Format is as follows:
;
; Database : <db name> : <type in hex> : <num sort orders> : <sort order specifier 1> ...
; This describes a database with one or more (up to 4) sort orders.
;
; A sort order specifier may be described in one of two ways:
; 1.  <hex propid> : <hex flags>
;     This describes a sort order on a single property.
; 2.  [ <num sort properties> : <hex propid 1> : <hex flags 1> ... ]
;     This describes a sort order on one or more (up to 3) properties.  Note that
;     "[ 1 : <hex propid> : <hex flags> ]" is equivalent to "<hex propid> : <hex flags>"
;
; So an example Database specifier might be:
; Database : "MyDatabase" : 0
;   : 4 : 0001001F : 0
;       : [ 3 : 0002001F : 0 : 0003001F : 0 : 0004001F : 0]
;       : 0003001F : 0
;       : [ 1 : 0004001F : 0 ]
; which describes a database with four sort orders, one of which is sorted on
; three properties.
;
; A database specifier can be followed by any number of record specifiers
; Record : 
;
; A record specifier can be followed by one or more field specifiers
; Field : <hex propid> : <value> [ either string or hex dword ]
;
; End   (ends a matching database or a record context)
